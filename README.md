# How to correctly pronounce 'GIF' and other analysis on Stack Overflow SurveyÂ Data

## Libraries Used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* MatplotLib
* SeaBorn


## Project Motivation
This analysis uses the survey results from 2017 StackOverflow survey spanning 51k participants.
I decided to use this data to uncover these three orthogonal topics.
* How to correctly pronounce GIF?
* Is there a gender gap in wages?
* What are the most common project management methodologies?

## File Descriptions
There are two data files
* survey_results_public.csv: The 2017 StackOverFlow Survery results.
* survey_results_schema.csv: Schema for the questions are asked in Survey.

There is one jupyter notebook
* StackOverflow_Analysis.ipynb: The notebook is used to analyse the three questions mentioned in Project Motivation.
